```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


library(knitr)    # For knitting document and include_graphics function
library(ggplot2)  # For plotting
library(png)      # For grabbing the dimensions of png files

img1_path <- "/Users/timodaehler/Desktop/COVID19DEBT/Plots/04/vis_miss_rawDF.png"
img1 <- readPNG(img1_path, native = TRUE, info = TRUE)
attr(img1, "info")

```{r}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, fig.width = 4}
# Bigger fig.width
include_graphics(img1_path)
```
